        # In the naive approach, we repeatedly check a substring to see if it has duplicate characters. But this is unnecessary. If a substring s_{ij}s from index i to j - 1 is already checked to have no duplicate characters, we only need to check if s[j] is already in the substring s.
        # A window is a range of elements in the array or string defined by the start and end indices, i.e., [i, j).
        # We use a set to store the characters in the current window, [i, j) (j = i initially). Then we slide the index j to the right, until we find a s[j] already in the HashSet. At this point, we found the maximum size of substrings without duplicate characters starting with index i. If we do this for all i, we get our answer.
        # Time complexity = O(2n) = O(n). This is because, in the worst case, each char will be visited twice by i and j.
        ans = i = j = 0
        hash_set = set()
        while i in range(len(s)) and j in range(len(s)):
            # Try to extend the range [i, j):
            if s[j] not in hash_set:
                hash_set.add(s[j])
                j += 1
                ans = max(ans, j - 1)
            else: # This is the most important part: Removing the first character from the set and moving i.
                hash_set.remove(s[i])
                i += 1
        return ans

        # SOLUTION 4: SLIDING WINDOW OPTIMIZED
        # Instead of using a set to detect duplicates, we can define a mapping of the characters to their indices. Then we can skip the characters immediately when we find a repeated character.

            ans = max(ans, j - i + 1) # The "+ 1" is another optimization. This is what allowed the loop condition to be in terms of j only. Think about the case of i = j = 0, where the answer should be 1.
