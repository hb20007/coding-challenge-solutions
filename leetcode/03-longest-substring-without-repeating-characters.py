        # In the naive approaches, we repeatedly check a substring to see if it has duplicate character. But it is unnecessary. If a substring s_{ij}s from index i to j - 1 is already checked to have no duplicate characters, we only need to check if s[j] is already in the substring s.
        # A window is a range of elements in the array/string which usually defined by the start and end indices, i.e. [i, j) (left-closed, right-open)
        # We use a set to store the characters in current window [i, j) (j = i initially). Then we slide the index j to the right. If it is not in the set, we slide j further. Doing so until s[j] is already in the HashSet. At this point, we found the maximum size of substrings without duplicate characters starting with index i. If we do this for all i, we get our answer.
        # Time complexity = O(2n) = O(n). This is because in the worst case each char will be visited twice by i and j.
        ans = i = j = 0
        hashset = set()
        while i in range(len(s)) and j in range(len(s)):    # Note while (i and j) in range(len(s)): doesn't work.
            # Try to extend the range [i, j)
            if s[j] not in hashset:
                hashset.add(s[j])
                j += 1
                ans = max(ans, j - 1)
            else:   # This is the most important part. Removing the first character from the set and moving i.
                hashset.remove(s[i])
                i += 1
        return ans

        # SOLUTION 4: SLIDING WINDOW OPTIMIZED
        # Instead of using a set to tell if a character exists or not, we could define a mapping of the characters to its index. Then we can skip the characters immediately when we found a repeated character.
        # Time complexity: O(n)

            ans = max(ans, j - i + 1)           # Why + 1? There is another optimization at play. It is this which allowed the loop condition to be in terms of j only. Take the case of i = j = 0 where the answer should be 1.
