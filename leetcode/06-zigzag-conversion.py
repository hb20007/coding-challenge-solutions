"""
The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this:
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR".
Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows.
For example, convert("PAYPALISHIRING", 3) should return "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR".

HINT:
The first step is to generalize the pattern for a string of size n.
